        <h2>Spotify Cookie Policy</h2>
        <h4>1. What are cookies?</h4>
        <p>Cookies are small pieces of text which are downloaded to your device, for 
          example, when you visit a website. Cookies are useful because they allow Spotify 
          and our partners to uniquely recognise your device and support the continuity of 
          your experience, for example by helping us to understand your preferences or past 
          actions. You can find more general information about cookies at: 
          www.allaboutcookies.org.</p>

          <h4>2. How do we use cookies?</h4>
        <p>Cookies do lots of different jobs, like letting you navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences, and generally improving your user experience. They can also help to ensure that ads you see online are more relevant to you and your interests.

          Spotify uses two main categories of cookie: (1) strictly necessary cookies; and (2) optional cookies:</p>
          <p>
            1. Strictly Necessary Cookies : These cookies are set by Spotify or a third party on our behalf, and are essential to enable you to use the features of our Services, such as technically delivering content, setting your privacy preferences, logging in, making payments or filling in forms. Without these cookies, our Services cannot be provided so you cannot decline them.</p>
          <p>
            2. Optional Cookies
            Optional cookies : may be 'first party cookies' or 'third party cookies'. First party cookies set directly by Spotify or by a third party at our request. Third party cookies are set directly by a third party or set by Spotify at the request of a third party, such as our analytics or advertising service providers. You can see a list of these partners at this link.</p>
          
          <h4>3. Options for managing cookies and interest-based ads</h4>
          <p>Web Browser Settings : You can use your web browser settings to accept, refuse and delete cookies. To do this, follow the instructions provided by your browser (usually located within the 'Help', 'Tools' or 'Edit' settings).</p>
          <p>Mobile Identifiers : On your mobile device, your operating system may provide you with additional options to opt out of interest based advertising or to otherwise reset your mobile identifiers. For example, you may use the 'Allow Apps to Request to Track' setting (on iOS devices) or the 'Opt out of Interest-Based Ads' setting (on Android devices). These settings allow you to limit the use of information about your use of apps for purposes of serving ads tailored to your interests.</p>
          
          <h4>4. Updates to this Policy</h4>
          <p>We may occasionally make changes to this Policy.</p>
          <p>When we make material changes to this Policy, we'll provide you with prominent notice as appropriate under the circumstances. For example, we may display a prominent notice within the Spotify Services or send you an email or device notification.</p>
